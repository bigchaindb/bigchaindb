# Introduction

BigchainDB is a scalable blockchain database. You can read about its motivations, goals and high-level architecture in the [BigchainDB whitepaper](https://www.bigchaindb.com/whitepaper/). This document, the _BigchainDB Documentation_, is intended primarily for:

1. Developers of BigchainDB server software.
2. People deploying and managing BigchainDB clusters.
3. Developers of BigchainDB driver software (SDKs used to develop client software).
4. App developers who are developing client apps to talk to one or more live, operational BigchainDB clusters. They would use one of the BigchainDB drivers.

If you're curious about what's in our roadmap, see [the ROADMAP.md file](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md) and [the list of open issues](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues). If you want to request a feature, file a bug report, or make a pull request, see [the CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).
