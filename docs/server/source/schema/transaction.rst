Transaction
-----------

This is the outer transaction wrapper. It contains the ID, version and the body of the transaction, which is also called ``transaction``.


Transaction.id
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** string

A sha3 digest of the transaction. The ID is calculated by removing all
derived hashes and signatures from the transaction, serializing it to
JSON with keys in sorted order and then hashing the resulting string
with sha3.



Transaction.transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** object

See: `Transaction Body`_.



Transaction.version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** integer

BigchainDB transaction schema version.





Transaction Body
----------------

See: `Transaction Body`_.


Transaction.operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** string

Type of the transaction:

A ``CREATE`` transaction creates an asset in BigchainDB. This
transaction has outputs (conditions) but no inputs (fulfillments),
so a dummy fulfillment is used.

A ``TRANSFER`` transaction transfers ownership of an asset, by providing
fulfillments to conditions of earlier transactions.

A ``GENESIS`` transaction is a special case transaction used as the
sole member of the first block in a BigchainDB ledger.



Transaction.asset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** object

Description of the asset being transacted.

See: `Asset`_.



Transaction.fulfillments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** array (object)

Array of the fulfillments (inputs) of a transaction.

See: Fulfillment_.



Transaction.conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** array (object)

Array of conditions (outputs) provided by this transaction.

See: Condition_.



Transaction.metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** object or null

User provided transaction metadata. This field may be ``null`` or may
contain an object with freeform metadata.

See: `Metadata`_.





Condition
----------

An output of a transaction. A condition describes a quantity of an asset
and what conditions must be met in order for it to be fulfilled. See also:
fulfillment_.


Condition.cid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** integer

Index of this condition's appearance in the `Transaction.conditions`_
array. In a transaction with 2 conditions, the ``cid``s will be 0 and 1.



Condition.condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** object

Body of the condition. Has the properties:

- **details**: Details of the condition.
- **uri**: Condition encoded as an ASCII string.



Condition.owners_after
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** array (string) or null

List of public keys associated with asset ownership at the time
of the transaction.



Condition.amount
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** integer

Integral amount of the asset represented by this condition.
In the case of a non divisible asset, this will always be 1.





Fulfillment
-----------

A fulfillment is an input to a transaction, named as such because it fulfills a condition of a previous transaction. In the case of a ``CREATE`` transaction, a fulfillment may provide no ``input``.

Fulfillment.fid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** integer

The offset of the fulfillment within the fulfillents array.



Fulfillment.owners_before
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** array (string) or null

List of public keys of the previous owners of the asset.



Fulfillment.fulfillment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** object or string

Fulfillment of a condition_, or put a different way, this is a
payload that satisfies a condition in order to spend the associated
asset.



Fulfillment.input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** object or null

Reference to a condition of a previous transaction





Asset
-----

Description of the asset being transacted. In the case of a ``TRANSFER``
transaction, this field contains only the ID of asset. In the case
of a ``CREATE`` transaction, this field may contain properties:


Asset.id
^^^^^^^^

**type:** string

A `UUID <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html>`_
of type 4 (random).



Asset.divisible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** boolean

Whether or not the asset has a quantity that may be partially spent.



Asset.updatable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** boolean

Whether or not the description of the asset may be updated. Defaults to false.



Asset.refillable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** boolean

Whether the amount of the asset can change after its creation. Defaults to false.



Asset.data
^^^^^^^^^^

**type:** object or null

User provided metadata associated with the asset. May also be ``null``.





Metadata
--------

User provided transaction metadata. This field may be ``null`` or may
contain an non empty object with freeform metadata.
