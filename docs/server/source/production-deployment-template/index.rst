Production Deployment Template
==============================

This section outlines how *we* deploy production BigchainDB nodes and clusters
on Microsoft Azure
using Kubernetes.
We improve it constantly.
You may choose to use it as a template or reference for your own deployment,
but *we make no claim that it is suitable for your purposes*.
Feel free change things to suit your needs or preferences.
