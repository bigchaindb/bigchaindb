Libraries and Tools Maintained by the BigchainDB Team
-----------------------------------------------------

* `Python Driver <https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/index.html>`_
* `JavaScript / Node.js Driver <https://github.com/bigchaindb/js-bigchaindb-driver>`_
* `The Transaction CLI <https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/cli/en/latest/>`_ is
  a command-line interface for building BigchainDB transactions.
  You may be able to call it from inside the language of
  your choice, and then use :ref:`the HTTP API <the-http-client-server-api>`
  to post transactions.
